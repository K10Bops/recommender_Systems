## Recommender Systems Project Summary

This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of three distinct recommender system approaches, following best practices in machine learning development and documentation.

### Project Objectives Completed
- **Data Preparation:**  
  - Applied a structured ML workflow using training, validation, and test splits.  
  - Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

- **Model Implementations:**  
  - **Content-Based Filtering:** Leveraged item metadata and user preferences to generate personalized recommendations.  
  - **Collaborative Filtering:** Built a user-item interaction model to capture behavioral patterns across users.  
  - **Matrix Factorization:** Applied latent factor models to uncover hidden relationships in sparse rating data.

- **Evaluation & Comparison:**  
  - Assessed each model using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, precision@k, recall@k).  
  - Compared performance across models to identify strengths and trade-offs.

- **Documentation & Transparency:**  
  - Developed a well-structured Jupyter Notebook with clear markdown explanations and inline comments.  
  - Included intermediate results, visualizations, and rationale for modeling decisions.

- **Conclusion:**  
  - Summarized key findings and performance insights.  
  - Reflected on model strengths, limitations, and potential improvements.

### Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
